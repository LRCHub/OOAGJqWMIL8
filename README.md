# Anne-Marie – I Don't Like Your Boyfriend

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
(I'm really sorry, but I don't like your boyfriend)
We're drivin' in silence
Please don't ask me what I think
'Cause it's hard for me to lie to you
I'm tryna stay quiet
But you can see it in my face
'Cause I know that he ain't good for you
But I'll try to get along
And I'll laugh at his jokes
I'll be nice and play dumb
You'll always be together
And I'll say that he's cute
I don't wanna be rude
I guess what I'm tryna say is
I don't like your boyfriend
Oh, shit, did I say that out loud?
I don't like your boyfriend
I think you should know (know)
If he was my boyfriend
I would let him go (go)
If you're asking me
I would pack my bags and leave
Go and get the man you need
'Cause I don't like your boyfriend
You know I got your back
Always let you live your life
But if I see something, I'ma say something (yeah, you got a type)
You want somebody cool
I'm tellin' you this one, he's just cold
He's so immature, not judgin' you, but it's gone on way too long
And I'll say that he's cute
I don't want to be rude
But what I really wanna say is
I don't like your boyfriend
I think you should know (know)
If he was my boyfriend
I would let him go (go)
If you're asking me
I would pack my bags and leave
Go and get the man you need
'Cause I don't like your boyfriend
I don't like your boyfriend
I don't like your boyfriend
I don't like your boyfriend
I don't like your boyfriend
Oh, it's not too late to leave him
You can stay at mine tonight (ah)
I just can't escape the feeling
Somethin' 'bout him isn't right
(I don't like your boyfriend)
I don't like your boyfriend
Oh, shit, did I say that out loud?
I don't like your boyfriend
I think you should know (know)
If he was my boyfriend
I would let him go (go)
If you're asking me
I would pack my bags and leave
Go and get the man you need
'Cause I don't like your boyfriend
I don't like your boyfriend
I don't like your boyfriend
I don't like your boyfriend
(I don't like your boyfriend)
